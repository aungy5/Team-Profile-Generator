  ## Description
  This application enables a Manager to create a webpage in which they can store basic information regarding each member of their team. The manager will be prompted to enter their information first, and then can add as many employees as they would like to their team. Once they are done adding members, an HTML page with all of their employees information will be generated, which they can later access if they need to grab some quick info regarding any of the members of their team.  
  ## Installation
  Users must install the npm inquirer package in order for this to work. The inquirer package is what allows us to prompt the user for input, so if they do not have the inquirer package the entire application will not work.

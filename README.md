  ## Description
  This application enables a Manager to create a webpage in which they can store basic information regarding each member of their team. The manager will be prompted to enter their information first, and then can add as many employees as they would like to their team. Once they are done adding members, an HTML page with all of their employees information will be generated, which they can later access if they need to grab some quick info regarding any of the members of their team.  
  ## Installation
  Users must install the npm inquirer package in order for this to work. The inquirer package is what allows us to prompt the user for input, so if they do not have the inquirer package the entire application will not work. 
  ## Usage
  To use this app, simply clone the repository, open up the repository in your terminal, and then type the command "node index.js" to run the application.
  ## Contributors
  No additional contributors on this project, but as always I do like to thank the instructional team for their help throughout this unit.
  ## Testing
  To test this project, you will need the npm jest package. Once you have installed the jest package, simply run npm test in the terminal and you will see that all unit tests pass.
